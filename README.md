### Start the app locally:

Clone the repo and install npm packages into the root and client folders. 

```
npm install
```
This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run seed
```
Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client via a proxy.
